## Getting Started

To set up the synthgen.org website locally or contribute to the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).
- A code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/synthgen-org/synthgen-website.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd synthgen-website
   ```
3. **Create a `.env` File**:  
   In the project root, create a new file named `.env` and add the following content:  
   ```plaintext
   PORT=8080
   ENVIRONMENT=development
   EMAIL_USER=[Your email address]
   EMAIL_PASS=[Your Gmail app password]
   ```  
   ( > **Note:** If you need help generating a Google app password, follow [this guide from Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en). )

4. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```  

5. **Start the Development Server**:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```  
   This will launch the website at `http://localhost:8080/` (or the port specified in `.env`).  

6. **Open the Project**:  
   - Open the project in your code editor.  
   - If necessary, modify `.env` to match your setup.  
   - Visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view the site.
